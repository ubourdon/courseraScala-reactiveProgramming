What is Reactive Programming ? 11:42

Reactive applications (readily responsive to a stimulus)
    event-driven (react to events)
    scalable (react to load)
    resilient (react to failures)
    responsive (react to users)

Event-driven
    Systems are composed from loosely coupled event handlers
        events can be handled asynchronously, without blocking
        
Scalable
    scale up : make use of parallelism in multi-core systems
    scale out : make use of multiple server nodes

    location transparency, resilience for scaling out
    
Resilient - recover quickly from failures
    
Responsive
    provides rich, real-time interation with its users under load & present failures


Event handling = callback
    exemple : listenner
            pb: needs shared mutable state
                cannot be composed
                leads quickly to "call-back hell"

How to do better ?
    Use fundamental constructions from functional programing ...
    
    ... to get COMPOSABLE event abstractions
    
    => Events are first class
    => Events are often represented as messages
    => Handlers of events are also first-class
    => Complex handlers can be composed from primitive ones
